<p>Create a function, <strong><code>read_file_first_line</code></strong>,
    that returns the first line in the provided <code>apache_log.txt</code> file</strong></p>

<p>To open this file, we would call the <code>open</code> function. The variable, <code>fileref</code>,
    now holds a reference to the file object returned by <code>open</code>. When we are finished with
    the file, we can close it by using the <code>close</code> method. After the file is closed any
    further attempts to use <code>fileref</code> will result in an error.</p>
