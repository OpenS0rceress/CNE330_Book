<p><strong>Write two functions, <code>get_first_octet</code>
    and <code>get_third_octet</code>.</strong></p>
<p><strong><code>get_first_octet</code> takes an IP address in, and
    returns the number first octet of the IP address</strong></p>
<p><strong>As an example, if you passed in the IP <code>192.168.76.1</code>
    the function would return <code>192</code></strong></p>
<p><strong><code>get_third_octet</code> takes an IP address in, and
    returns the number third octet of the IP address</strong></p>
<p><strong>As an example, if you passed in the IP <code>192.168.76.1</code>
    the function would return <code>76</code></strong></p>

<div class="hint">The output of the functions should only have numbers, no periods.</div></li>

<p>The slice operator <code>[n:m]</code> returns the part of the string from the n’th
    character to the m’th character, including the first but excluding the last.
    In other words, start with the character at index n and go up to but do not
    include the character at index m. This behavior may seem counter-intuitive
    but if you recall the <code>range</code> function, it did not include its end point either.</p>
<p>If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string.
    If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string.</p>
