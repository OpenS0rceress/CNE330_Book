<p><strong>Write a function, <code>create_ip_address</code>,
    that takes in four IP octets as integers and returns the full IP address.
    If they are the same length, return either IP address.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As an example, if you passed in the numbers <code>192</code>, <code>168</code>,
    <code>76</code>, and <code>1</code> the function would return
    <code>192.168.76.1</code>.</strong></p>

<div class="hint">Make sure to convert the variables to strings</div></li>

<p>Interestingly, the <code>+</code> operator does work with strings, but for strings, the + operator represents <strong>concatenation</strong>, not addition. Concatenation means joining the two operands by linking them end-to-end.</p>
