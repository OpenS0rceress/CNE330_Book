<p>Write a function, <strong><code>slice_ips</code></strong>,
    that takes a list of IP addresses in, and returns the second and third entries in the list.
    If there are less than 3 entries, return an empty list i.e. []</strong></p>

<div class="hint">List elements start at 0. This means if you try to access the third entry with 3,
    you will receive the 4th entry. </div></li>

<p>The slice operation we saw with strings also work on lists. Remember that the first index is the starting point
    for the slice and the second number is one index past the end of the slice (up to but not including that element).
    Recall also that if you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the sequence.
    If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the sequence.</p>
