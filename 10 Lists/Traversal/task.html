<p>Write a function, <strong><code>return_all_192_168</code></strong>,
    that takes a list of IP addresses in, and returns all ips that start with 192.168.</p>
<p>If there are no entries that begin with 192.168, return an empty list i.e. []</p>

<p>It is also possible to perform list traversal using iteration by item as well as iteration by index.</p>
