<strong><p>The DHCP service on your network assigns IPs in the following way:</p>
<li>A server is Linux if the last octet is divisible by 3</li>
<li>A server is Mac if the last octet is divisible by 5</li>
<li>A server is Windows if the last octet is divisible by 3 and 5</li>
<p>Write a function, <code>linux_mac_windows</code>, that takes an IP range and how many addresses
    are available for that OS.</strong></p>

<p>Testing plays an important role in the development of software.
    To this point, most of the testing you have done has probably involved
    running your program and fixing errors as you notice them.</p>
<p>Python provides a statement called the <code>assert</code> statement
    that can be used to check function preconditions. An <code>assert</code> statement
    checks the value of a boolean expression. If the expression is <code>true</code>,
    the assert statement allows the program to proceed normally. But if the expression is
     <code>false</code>, the assert statement signals an error and stops the program.</p>
<p>A programmer using Test-First Development writes a new function using the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>First, create the function interface and docstring.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, create a unit test for the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the unit test. It should fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the body of the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the unit test. If it fails, debug the function, and run the test again. Repeat until the test passes.</p></li>
</ol>
